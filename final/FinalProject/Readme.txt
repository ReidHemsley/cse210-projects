This program generates a PROMPT used by AI (such as ChatGPT) to create a Dungeons and Dragons character.
The program will ask the user what aspects of a D&D character they would like to be generated by ChatGPT (un subsequently this program)
The user will have the options to manually enter information such as a name for the character or specific stats/attributes.
Any information not added by the user will be marked for generation via AI.

To use the program simply,
    - Run the program and press the 'Enter' key to create a new prompt.
    - Answer the questions to specify the desired content of the prompt.
    - Choose a file to save the prompt to (a text/.txt file is recommended).
    - Copy the prompt from the console or from the file it was saved on.
    - Paste the prompt into ChatGPT (or a ChatGPT alternative).
    - Enjoy the results.

For extra fun, consider using OpenAI's image generation tool, Dall-E, to create an image of your character.
ChatGPT 3.5 is free and only requires an email address.

This program was meant to help those not familiar with AI to see the power and fun you can have using well worded prompts/instructions.
